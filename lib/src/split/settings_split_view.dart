/// A settings screen that shows the list and the selected page side by side
/// when there is room (iPad, tablets, unfolded foldables, desktop and web),
/// and the list with pages pushed over it otherwise.
///
/// Give tiles a [SettingsDestination] (`SettingsTile.navigation(destination:
/// ...)`); tapping one shows its page. With two panes the tile stays
/// highlighted and pages opened from inside the page push inside the detail
/// pane, like iPad Settings.
///
/// The per-style defaults follow the platform apps:
///
/// | Style | Two panes when | List pane |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | iOS | width >= 600 and shortest side >= 600 (any shortest side on desktop) | 320pt sidebar |
/// | Android, Fuchsia | width >= 720 and shortest side >= 600, like AOSP Settings | 36.36% of the width |
/// | Web | width > 980, like Chrome | 266px menu |
/// | macOS | width >= 560 | 232pt System Settings sidebar |
/// | Windows | width >= 641 | 300px navigation pane from 1008, a 48px icon rail below |
/// | GNOME | width > 550 (scaled by the text size) | a quarter of the width, 180–280 |
///
/// The desktop styles draw their list pane like their platforms' settings
/// apps:
///
/// - macOS: a full-height sidebar with 32pt rows, a rounded selection in the
///   accent color (grey while the window is inactive) and small bold section
///   headers. The detail pane has a 52pt toolbar with the page title and,
///   when there is a page to go back to, the back and forward buttons.
/// - Windows: a `NavigationView` pane with a sliding accent pill on the
///   selected item. Between 641 and 1007 the pane is an icon rail with
///   tooltips; its menu button opens the full pane over the page. The page
///   title is large, and pages opened from a page show a breadcrumb.
/// - GNOME: an `AdwNavigationSplitView` sidebar with rounded rows and its
///   own header bar. The detail pane has a flat header bar with a centered
///   title, and a back button when collapsed or on a nested page. With one
///   pane no row stays selected.
///
/// In the three desktop styles the arrow keys move between the sidebar's
/// rows, Enter or Space opens one (macOS opens the row as the focus moves,
/// like its sidebars), and Tab moves between the panes.
///
/// A separating hinge (a hinge, or a fold in the book posture) always gets a
/// pane on each side of it. The panes follow the text direction.
///
/// Use it as a whole screen: it draws the headers of both panes, so don't
/// put it under an app bar.
///
/// With two panes, a tile that pushes a route itself (for example
/// `onPressed: (context) => Navigator.of(context).push(...)`) pushes it on
/// the app's navigator. With one pane the list sits in the view's own
/// navigator, so the route goes there: back closes it first, named routes
/// come from the app's navigator, and the view keeps one pane until the
/// route has closed, even if the window widens meanwhile (the route covers
/// the view either way). Menus and bottom sheets opened from the list work
/// the same way.
///
/// When the tile of the page the user picked goes away (a conditional page
/// such as Developer options), the page closes: two panes go back to the
/// [initialDestinationId] page, one pane to the list, and the page doesn't
/// come back by itself with its tile. The view reads the tiles of each
/// [SettingsSection] ahead; a tile inside a [CustomSettingsSection] is only
/// known once it has built, so its page stays open when it goes away. Call
/// [SettingsSplitController.clearSelection] when you remove such a tile.
